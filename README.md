# Brawl Stars Tracker Project

## Description

The Brawl Stars Tracker is designed to give players insights into leaderboard positions, and events occuring within Brawlstars. Through using the official Brawl Stars API, the application collects real-time data, allowing users to:

- Monitor Leaderboard Standings Overtime
- Compare standings with friends or club members
- Checkout daily events occuring
- Details about recommended brawlers for different maps

This is achieved by using the [Brawl Stars API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/).
The application is built using Flutter, allowing for compatibility across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and web browsers.
